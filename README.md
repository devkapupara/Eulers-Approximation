<h1>Euler's Approximation</h1>
<p>Approximates the solution to an ODE using Euler's Approximation given the initial conditions. Calculates error at all defined points given that the user provides the Analytical Function.</p>
<h2>Defining Functions and the variables</h2>
<p>Use x**y to raise x by y. Normal use for +, * and /. To incorporate use of trigonometric identities, use m.sin(x), m.cos(x) and so on. For any mathematical function contained within the Python math library, use m.functioName(args).</p>
<p>Use appropriate brackets in order of their computation. Need to compute and enter the Analytical Function by hand in order to compute errors.</p>
